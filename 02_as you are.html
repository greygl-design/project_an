			<h1>As You Are</h1>

			<p>
I love you as you are
who I really fell for.
The one who could end this war,
this war in which my mind battled afore.

You're different, and special,
nobody can outshine you, nor reach your level.
To be honest, you linger in my dreams every night,
yet your arms feel like the safest place to hide.

I love you to the moon and back.
I know I'm being corny.
But you won't understand, it's what your brain capacity lacks.
I'm just kidding, but really, I love you to the moon and back.

I'm thankful that we met,
and so glad that they merged our sections.
Even if you made me mad, even if you weren't the best,
you are the only exception.

You changed my life, I'm saying this again,
if it weren't for you, my year would've had a bad end.
And even as our days would slowly wend,
I never thought we'd become more than friends.

You might've been the best memory, my finest muse.
Whenever I'm overwhelmed, you're someone I run to.
You're the reason I never would wanna wear a noose,
because my eyes keep telling me, that you're the most beautiful view.
