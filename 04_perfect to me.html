			<h1> Perfect To Me </h1>

			<p>
You're <b>perfect</b> to me,
I don't mean in compatibility.
You're perfect, like someone I'd wanna be,
or perfect, like stars above the moonlit sea.

So <b>beautiful</b>, it's hard to look away,
especially the overwhelming fragrance of your perfume spray.
Honestly it makes my life less dull and gray,
Oh, for you, I'd give my heart on a tray

You're <b>amazing</b>, there's no doubt,
even if I'm with others, you're all I think about.
And sometimes, on the most-busiest days,
I wish you were there, because your presence takes all my frustrations away.

I used to think you were too <b>cool</b> for me,
especially at the start, you always talked so rudely.
But when I finally gained your trust,
you brushed away my loneliness simply like dust.

You have a lot of <b>humour</b> in you,
always made me laugh in the little bits
A second ago I was angry, now I'm confused,
because now I'm suddenly laughing, your effect on me really is true.

You're <i>way</i> too <b>hilarious</b>, it's surprising,
no wonder it's so fun talking with you.
And your smile is just so mesmerizing,
You've got a hold of my heart. Why? I have no clue.
