			<h1> Perfect To Me </h1>

			<p>
You're perfect to me,
I don't mean in compatibility.
You're perfect, like someone I'd wanna be,
or perfect, like stars above the moonlit sea.

So beautiful, it's hard to look away,
and the overwhelming fragrance of your perfume spray.
Honestly it makes my life less dull and gray,
Oh, for you, I'd give my heart on a tray

You're amazing, there's no doubt,
even if I'm with others, you're all I think about.
And sometimes, on the most-busiest days,
I wish you were there, because your presence takes all my frustrations away.

I used to think you were too cool for me,
especially at the start, you always talked rudely.
But when I finally gained your trust,
you brushed away my loneliness simply like dust.

You have a lot of humour in you,
always made me laugh in the little bits
A second ago I was angry, now I'm confused,
because right now I was laughing, your effect on me is true.

You're way too hilarious, it's surprising
no wonder it's so fun to talk with you
And your smile just so mesmerizing,
You've got a hold of my heart. Why? I have no clue.
