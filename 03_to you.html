			<h1>to you</h1>

			<p>
To the friend in you,
the best person I ever came across,
You cheered me up when my days were blue,
and somehow lessened my anxious thoughts.

My life changed so drastically when I met you,
the lonely and quiet one to the cheerful and loud one.
You made me into someone so new. 
Oh, how could I ever live without you?

And all those moments we spent together,
the bond we had during those days,
I'll cherish them always and forever. 
And I hope it all never fades.

because even after all this,
even if I find someone new.
You'll always be the one I reminisce.
And I'll always be thinking of you.


And to the lover in you,
the best I'll ever have
the best I've ever felt.
I can't believe all of this is even true.

You've given so much, and so little too.
A jackass for teasing me till I go crying in the washroom.
But also my darling for listening to me.
for laughing with me and keeping me happy.

Sometimes you act stupid and immature.
Sometimes so sweet you'd make me wish for more.
Sometimes you're annoying and someone I want to ignore,
but I can't do that, because you're the only one I adore.

 All the moments I've had with you,
the feelings we share, the connection that grew.
I hope I'll never <i> have </i> to forget you, at least not anytime soon.
You're the best I've ever felt, nobody can ever be compared to you.

Because you always make me feel some kind of way.
A warmth and a bond I hope would never change.
You're not just an experience in my life, you're a lesson learnt.
Even if you may be my biggest heartbreak, even if I'm yet to yearn.

Yearn for you, because that's what I'll always do.
When you're not online or when I'm far away from you.
I'm always thinking of you, even if we're in the same room.
I wanna listen to you, even if you tell me something I already knew.

I wanna comfort you and make you feel safe.
To heal away your troubles even if you cause me a headache.
I wanna tell you how much I'd wanna love you forever,
but it just feels so risky to say, do you think this relationship will endeavour?

So, to the friend in you
and the lover in you,


I love you.
