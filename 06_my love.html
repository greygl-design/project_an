			<h1>My Love</h1>

			<p>
My love, my all, my dear,
a brisky road to light unfolds,
when the fog thickens, you make it clear.
For you there's plenty much love I hold.

That day we held hands for the first time,
in the planetarium with the artificial night sky.
It felt so ethereal, once in a lifetime,
i could barely think of anything, I'm just so glad that you're mine.

You bring me a sense of euphoria,
and a feeling where I suffice.
Maybe that's why, sweet magnolia,
I might've just fallen in love with you twice.

Once for your presence and company,
and second for the spark you brought in me.
And although at first I thought you were heartless,
I'm glad I was wrong, I might just love you regardless.

If I had a coin for each song I love that doesn't echo you through,
I'd have not a single one.
Every melody somehow leads my thoughts back to you,
my world's been yours ever since it begun.

And when they take my ashes to the ganga river,
when my lifeless body burns apart.
May the smoke only have your scent to deliver,
when the fire reaches my heart.
