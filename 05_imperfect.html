			<h1> Imperfect </h1>

			<p>
in the way you laugh
or when you show me that stupid smile
or when you try to teach me maths
It's not like I wouldn't drift into your eyes.

So sorry if I never listened
and sorry for the times I made you upset.
I only ever want your pain to lessen,
and I don't want you to go just yet.

You're everything to me,
the best person I've ever met.
I'm not even kidding,
though you probably think I'm lying, I bet.

On the first day after exams, you attended school with a crappy haircut,
I wanted to laugh so loud but I had to keep my mouth shut.
But from that moment, I knew,
I had fallen in love with you.

I remember that day you sat behind me in art class;
It felt so off, like something I couldn’t grasp.
I didn't talk much, just overwhelmed in the moment a bit,
lost in a swirl of thoughts I wasn’t ready to admit.

Admit what? You might ask.
I'm sure you can guess,
I've yapped enough, gone off my track,
'cause the poem is about flaws, not this unrelated mess.

If you're busy and can't talk,
I'll sit down, scroll your pictures and stalk. :>
or feel bad you haven't replied,
but no worries, all you need to tell me is why.

I might be greedy for your love
or over-exaggerate every little thing you do.
But I promise, if you give me a reason, I'll listen through,
because I really just wanna understand and fix things with you.

And even if you added too much salt in those noodles you brought to lunch,
I loved it because I already had too much of a sweet bunch.
You told me "Why are you eating? It's not even that good".
Baby, if it's what makes you smile, I would.

And that day you made me play Cabin Crew,
we went on call, I absolutely loved to chat with you.
In those small moments, something in my heart bloomed,
your laugh, your voice, it felt like our bond instantly grew.

I often wonder about your thoughts,
your opinions, what you're feeling and your hidden flaws.
If only I could surprise you with what you might like,
maybe I could see your mesmerizing smile, one more time.
